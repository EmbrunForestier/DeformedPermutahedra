# DeformedPermutahedra
Family of 656 indecomposable deformed 5-permutahedra which are pairwise fertile


Each polytope is given as a list of vertices in R^5.

Each line starts with [ and end with ].

Each polytope is a indecomposable deformed permutahedron in R^5.

No two polytopes are combinatorially equivalent.

Every pair of polytopes is fertile.

See article [insert ArXiv link], Example 3.23 for the details (and the algorithm that created this list).
